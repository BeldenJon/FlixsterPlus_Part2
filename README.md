## Notes

Biggest challenge was from outside class distractions. Technically, I am having a hard time figuring out when things
are not working due to not having libraries installed and when the code is incorrect. On this project I was caught "between"
how I think I can make it work and how the lab was done. I how to find some time Wednesday to figure this project out since
currentlly it does not work as it should.
